The repositories can be made public which help with transparentcy.\n","\n","Reposirories on github allows version control which enable their users to track changes such as mofifying, adding and deliting codes or data over time. This allow other people who rely on the code to know the current version of the code as well as what were the changes from the orginal code. This also reduce the risk of missing or outdated files that can impede reproducibility. People can also include README files and comments in the code, which could include the reason why certain code was included. This make the code more well-documented and allowing other user to understand the context of the code and analysis.\n","\n","Github also opeen the user to collaboration because public repsiroties can allow user to leave comments on the code or data that the user can use the feedback to improve or debug their code. These repositories centralizes all the materials related to the project by allowing the user to upload their source code, datasets, configuration files, and doccumentation. As mentioned earlier, public repositories can improve transparecy because the code are shared to the public. It allows other user to evaluate the code and as well as using the code to analyze their own work. This can improve trust in the research because other are allowed to analyze the code to look for potential mistakes that could impact the result or outcome of the analysis.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Mc_KEiX4brXi"}}]}
